# Welcome to Tascana!

Tascana is a todo app helping you achieve big goals in a calm way.

The key idea of Tascana is to shift the mindset of short term tasks (most of the current todo apps) to long term goals.Â 

- Allow users to define yearly goals

- Allow users to define monthly goals connected to their yearly goals

- Allow users to define daily tasks connected to their monthly goals

- Split days in 3 parts: morning, afternoon, evening
